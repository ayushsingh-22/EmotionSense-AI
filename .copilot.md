# Copilot Project Instructions

## Documentation Rules
- **Do NOT create any `README.md` file** unless I clearly say: **"Create README"**.
- If you think a README or documentation could be useful, **ask me first**.
- Do not auto-suggest placeholder text like:
  - "This is a project"
  - "Add description here"
  - or any boilerplate README templates.

## Code Generation Style
- Focus on writing code only, not project descriptions.
- Do not add comments explaining obvious logic unless requested.
- When unsure about requirements, ask a clarifying question instead of assuming.

## Behavior Guidelines
- Before generating any documentation file (README, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, etc.), **ask for confirmation**.
- If I ask for new file scaffolding (like React / Node / Python project), **exclude README** by default.

### Example (Correct):
> "I have created the project structure. No README was created as instructed."

### Example (Wrong):
> Automatically creating any README.md file.

---

Follow these rules strictly across the entire project.
